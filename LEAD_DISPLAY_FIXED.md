# 🔧 Lead Display Fixed with Detailed Modal!

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The lead display issues have been **completely fixed**! The problem was that the API was returning raw Apify data (snake_case) instead of processed database data (camelCase).

### **🔧 Root Cause:**
The API was returning the raw Apify response data which uses snake_case field names (`first_name`, `last_name`, etc.), but the React components expect camelCase field names (`firstName`, `lastName`, etc.) that match the database schema.

### **✅ Solution Applied:**

1. **Fixed Data Source**:
   - Changed API to return processed data from database instead of raw Apify response
   - Database data uses correct camelCase field names that match component interfaces

2. **Added Detailed Modal**:
   - Created `LeadDetailModal.tsx` component with comprehensive lead information
   - Shows all available fields in organized sections
   - Includes personal info, company info, description, keywords, and technologies

3. **Enhanced Lead Cards**:
   - Made cards clickable with hover effects
   - Added visual indicators for clickable cards
   - Integrated modal functionality

4. **Improved Data Display**:
   - Fixed field name mapping between API response and database
   - Ensured all lead information is properly displayed
   - Added proper fallbacks for missing data

### **🚀 Current Status:**

- ✅ **Lead Names**: Now displaying correctly (no more "Name not available")
- ✅ **All Fields**: Properly mapped and displayed
- ✅ **Detailed Modal**: Click any card to see comprehensive information
- ✅ **Data Source**: Using processed database data with correct field names
- ✅ **User Experience**: Enhanced with clickable cards and detailed views

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

1. **Search for leads** using the form
2. **See results** in a responsive grid with proper names and info
3. **Click any card** to open detailed modal with:
   - Personal information (name, job title, email, LinkedIn, location)
   - Company information (name, industry, size, revenue, funding, address)
   - Company description
   - Keywords (first 20 with "+ more..." indicator)
   - Technologies used
   - Company LinkedIn profile

### **🔧 Technical Details:**

#### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
// API returned raw Apify data
return NextResponse.json({ leads: apifyResponse.data })

// Components expected camelCase but got snake_case
lead.first_name  // ❌ Undefined
lead.last_name   // ❌ Undefined
```

#### After (Correct):
```typescript
// API returns processed database data
const savedLeads = await prisma.lead.findMany({
  where: { searchHistoryId: searchHistory.id }
})
return NextResponse.json({ leads: savedLeads })

// Components get correct camelCase fields
lead.firstName   // ✅ Works
lead.lastName    // ✅ Works
```
