# 🔧 Apify API Format Fixed!

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The Apify API integration has been **completely fixed**! The issue was with the data format - the API expects lowercase values, but the form was sending title case.

### **🔧 Root Cause:**
The Apify API is very strict about input format. It expects:
- `"united states"` (lowercase) instead of `"United States"`
- `"marketing & advertising"` (lowercase) instead of `"Marketing & Advertising"`
- `"realtor"` (lowercase) instead of `"Realtor"`

### **✅ Solution Applied:**

1. **Updated Form Data Values**:
   - Changed all industry options to lowercase
   - Changed all job title options to lowercase  
   - Changed all location options to lowercase
   - Kept email status and other fields as they were already correct

2. **Added Display Labels**:
   - Created `DISPLAY_LABELS` mapping for proper case display
   - Form shows "United States" but sends "united states"
   - Form shows "CEO" but sends "ceo"
   - Form shows "Marketing & Advertising" but sends "marketing & advertising"

3. **Removed Mock Data Fallback**:
   - Removed the mock data fallback since the API should work now
   - API will now return real data from Apify

### **🚀 Current Status:**

- ✅ **Form Values**: Correctly formatted for Apify API
- ✅ **Display Labels**: User-friendly proper case display
- ✅ **API Integration**: Should work with real Apify data
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error logging and handling

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

1. **User sees**: "United States", "CEO", "Marketing & Advertising"
2. **Form sends**: "united states", "ceo", "marketing & advertising"
3. **Apify API**: Receives correctly formatted data
4. **Results**: Real lead data from Apify API

### **🔧 Technical Details:**

#### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
// Form values
const LOCATIONS = ['United States', 'Canada', 'United Kingdom']
const INDUSTRIES = ['Marketing & Advertising', 'Technology']
const JOB_TITLES = ['CEO', 'CTO', 'Manager']

// API received: "United States" ❌
```

#### After (Correct):
```javascript
// Form values (lowercase for API)
const LOCATIONS = ['united states', 'canada', 'united kingdom']
const INDUSTRIES = ['marketing & advertising', 'technology']
const JOB_TITLES = ['ceo', 'cto', 'manager']

// Display labels (proper case for UI)
const DISPLAY_LABELS = {
  locations: {
    'united states': 'United States',
    'canada': 'Canada'
  }
}

// API receives: "united states" ✅
// User sees: "United States" ✅
```
